I am currently doing business as capital property group llc here in las Vegas. I must say i apply a rather more direct approach with borrowers , that helps to save time and hassle of conventional channels with less paperwork. I am also not limited to real estate deals, I&#39;m mostly flexible to consider any project presented to me. I can do 100 % financing for up to $25M, with max term of 15 years in as much as i prefer short term deals. I know time is always a huge factor so i do my best always to meet up even before closing dates. I am active and capable to deal whenever a solid deal is presented to me. You can request for our website for more information</p>"
